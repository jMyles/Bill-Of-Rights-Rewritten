* Only by due process of law can any government punish anyone or take anything from anyone.

* No government can take any private property for public use without fair compensation.

This document, taken together, may be referred to as a "Bill of Rights."  However, this Bill of Rights is not the *source* of the rights in question - it merely outlines a few of them explicitly.  It is also not exhaustive.  

No government actor may use the absence of a right in this document to disparage or deny a right not mentioned here.

# 10 

If the Constitution does not specifically delegate a power to the national government, that power is reserved for the states or for individual people.
